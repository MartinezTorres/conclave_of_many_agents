# COMA Development Todo List

**NOTE: Before tackling any items below, these must be prioritized first based on project goals and requirements.**

## Priority 1 - Critical (Must Fix Now)
- [ ] Add license file to repository
- [ ] Install and verify OpenAI dependency
- [ ] Add OpenAI API key validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for both providers
- [ ] Add graceful error handling for network failures
- [ ] Implement timeout handling for Claude Code sessions

## Priority 2 - Essential (Before Release)
- [ ] Test end-to-end functionality with real repository
- [ ] Verify hooks trigger correctly in Claude Code
- [ ] Test cleanup process works properly
- [ ] Add installation and setup instructions to README

## Priority 3 - Important (Quality of Life)
- [ ] Add configuration options for timeouts and prompts
- [ ] Implement verbose/debug mode
- [ ] Add real usage examples to documentation

## Priority 4 - Nice to Have
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add performance metrics and logging

## Architecture & Design Improvements (Needs Prioritization)
- [ ] **Dual Mode Architecture**: Design clear separation between "Simple Protective Wrapper" and "Development Assistant" modes
- [ ] **File Reading for Acolytes**: Enable acolytes to read actual file contents for informed decisions
- [ ] **Acolyte Specialization**: Create file-type specific acolytes (JS, Python, Config, etc.)
- [ ] **Role-based Acolytes**: Implement specialized roles (security, performance, style, documentation)
- [ ] **Change Context Awareness**: Provide acolytes with user intent and commit message context
- [ ] **Cross-file Analysis**: Enable acolytes to understand relationships between modified files

## Security & Safety Improvements (Needs Prioritization)
- [ ] **API Key Security**: Implement secure credential management and sandboxing
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Add OpenAI API rate limiting and cost controls
- [ ] **Prompt Injection Protection**: Secure acolyte prompts against malicious input
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Log all acolyte decisions and reasoning for review
- [ ] **Decision History**: Track acolyte performance and false positive/negative rates

## User Experience Enhancements (Needs Prioritization)
- [ ] **Interactive Mode**: Allow follow-up questions and context provision to acolytes
- [ ] **Override Mechanism**: Provide way to bypass acolyte rejections with justification
- [ ] **Real-time Feedback**: Show acolyte analysis as user types/edits
- [ ] **Conflict Resolution**: Help resolve disagreements between acolytes
- [ ] **Learning Mode**: Allow acolytes to learn from user corrections

## Configuration Management (Needs Prioritization)
- [ ] **Project Profiles**: Create repository-specific acolyte configurations
- [ ] **Team Settings**: Shared acolyte behavior across team members
- [ ] **Custom Prompts**: Allow customization of acolyte system prompts per project
- [ ] **Ruleset Management**: Define and share coding standards as acolyte rules
- [ ] **Training Data**: Feed project-specific examples to acolytes

## Integration Features (Needs Prioritization)
- [ ] **Git Integration**: Understand git history, branches, and conflict detection
- [ ] **Pull Request Workflow**: Integrate with GitHub/GitLab PR processes
- [ ] **IDE Extensions**: VS Code, JetBrains, and other editor integrations
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, automated testing
- [ ] **Multi-developer Coordination**: Handle concurrent changes from team members

## Completed Items
- [x] Create standard npm directory structure
- [x] Implement dual provider system (Claude Code + OpenAI)
- [x] Remove redundant MCP server implementation
- [x] Fix provider interface consistency
- [x] Clean up file references and imports
- [x] Update documentation for new architecture

## Notes
- Keep this list updated as we discover new requirements
- Mark items as completed when finished
- Add priority labels for new items
- Include brief descriptions for complex tasks
