# COMA Development Todo List

**NOTE: Before tackling any items below, these must be prioritized first based on project goals and requirements.**

## Priority 0 - Immediate (Consistency Audit)
- [x] Check package.json for consistency
- [x] Check LICENSE for consistency
- [x] Check README.md for consistency
- [x] Check ARCHITECTURE.md for consistency
- [x] Check TODO.md for consistency
- [x] Check .gitignore for consistency
- [x] Check src/claude-coma.js for consistency
- [x] Check src/coma-validator.js for consistency
- [x] Check src/context-capturer.js for consistency
- [x] Check src/context-manager.js for consistency
- [x] Check src/providers/claude-code.js for consistency
- [x] Check test/test-runner.js for consistency
- [x] Check test/test-providers.js for consistency
- [x] Check test/test-hook-management.js for consistency
- [x] Check test/test-consensus-logic.js for consistency
- [x] Check test/test-context-capture.js for consistency
- [x] Check test/test-file-scanning.js for consistency
- [x] Check test/test-error-scenarios.js for consistency
- [x] Check test/test-shakespeare-integration.cjs for consistency

## Priority 1 - Critical (Must Fix Now)
- [x] **Test end-to-end functionality with real repository** (✅ Integrated test suite with `claude-coma test`)
- [x] **Verify hooks trigger correctly in Claude Code** (✅ Integration test validates hook triggering)
- [x] **Add installation and setup instructions to README** (✅ Updated with test commands)

## Priority 2 - Essential (Before Release)
- [ ] Add configuration options for timeouts and prompts
- [x] **Implement verbose/debug mode** (✅ Added --debug flag with atomic logging)
- [ ] Add real usage examples to documentation
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

## Priority 3 - Important (Quality of Life)
- [x] **Add performance metrics and logging** (✅ Debug logging system implemented)
- [ ] Context capture hook testing with real Claude Code sessions

## Architecture & Design Improvements (Future)
- [x] **File Reading for Agents**: Enable agents to read actual file contents for informed decisions (✅ Already implemented via --allowed-tools)
- [x] **Change Context Awareness**: Provide agents with user intent and commit message context (✅ Implemented via context capture system)
- [ ] **Dual Mode Architecture**: Design clear separation between "Simple Protective Wrapper" and "Development Assistant" modes
- [ ] **Agent Specialization**: Create file-type specific agents (JS, Python, Config, etc.)
- [ ] **Role-based Agents**: Implement specialized roles (security, performance, style, documentation)
- [ ] **Cross-file Analysis**: Enable agents to understand relationships between modified files
- [ ] **Enhanced Context Capture**: Capture more than 5 recent messages, include user prompts

## Security & Safety Improvements (Future)
- [x] **Agent Sandboxing**: Restrict agent tools to read-only operations (✅ Implemented via --allowed-tools)
- [ ] **API Key Security**: Implement secure credential management and sandboxing
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Add provider rate limiting and cost controls
- [ ] **Prompt Injection Protection**: Secure agent prompts against malicious input
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Log all agent decisions and reasoning for review
- [ ] **Decision History**: Track agent performance and false positive/negative rates

## User Experience Enhancements (Needs Prioritization)
- [ ] **Interactive Mode**: Allow follow-up questions and context provision to agents
- [ ] **Override Mechanism**: Provide way to bypass agent rejections with justification
- [ ] **Real-time Feedback**: Show agent analysis as user types/edits
- [ ] **Conflict Resolution**: Help resolve disagreements between agents
- [ ] **Learning Mode**: Allow agents to learn from user corrections

## Configuration Management (Needs Prioritization)
- [ ] **Project Profiles**: Create repository-specific agent configurations
- [ ] **Team Settings**: Shared agent behavior across team members
- [ ] **Custom Prompts**: Allow customization of agent system prompts per project
- [ ] **Ruleset Management**: Define and share coding standards as agent rules
- [ ] **Training Data**: Feed project-specific examples to agents

## Integration Features (Needs Prioritization)
- [ ] **Git Integration**: Understand git history, branches, and conflict detection
- [ ] **Pull Request Workflow**: Integrate with GitHub/GitLab PR processes
- [ ] **IDE Extensions**: VS Code, JetBrains, and other editor integrations
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, automated testing
- [ ] **Multi-developer Coordination**: Handle concurrent changes from team members

## Recent Major Improvements (January 2025)
- [x] **Permanent Hook Installation**: Simplified to install-once model, no temporary backup/restore
- [x] **Transparent Operation**: Hooks installed permanently but only active when CLAUDE_COMA=1 set
- [x] **Unified Entry Point**: All hooks now route through 'claude-coma hook <type>' for consistency
- [x] **Environment-Based Activation**: Perfect integration with other Claude Code tools
- [x] **Debug Logging System**: Comprehensive atomic logging with --debug flag support
- [x] **Updated Test Suite**: All tests updated for new permanent hook architecture
- [x] **Architecture Documentation**: ARCHITECTURE.md updated to reflect new design
- [x] **Cleanup Instructions**: Changed from automatic cleanup to user-friendly instructions
- [x] **Integrated Test Runner**: Self-contained test suite via `claude-coma test` command
- [x] **No Executable Scripts**: Converted all tests to importable modules for security
- [x] **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests + integration test with environment validation
- [x] **ASCII-Only Output**: Clean, professional test results following design principles
